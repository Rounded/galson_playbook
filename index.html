						<blockquote>
						  <p>We have a chance to do some things that simply aren't being done in this industry</p>
						</blockquote>

						<p>Over the past 6 weeks, Galson opened its doors to the Rounded team.  During that period, we conducted 9 one-on-one internal interviews. Our intent was to answer the following questions --</p>

						<ol>
							<li>What is Galson's core business? How does it operate?</li>
							<li>What is the measure of success & failure?</li>
							<li>What is technology's current role at Galson?  And what role might it play in the future?</li>
							<li>The one that kept coming up: What do customers mean to Galson?</li>
						</ol>

						<h2 class="section-header">Beliefs</h2>
						<blockquote>
						  <p>When the customer asks for something, we just do it. We are very customer focused.</p>
						</blockquote>

						<p>Your company's best decisions take their cue from its set of values.</p>

						<ol>
							<li>How customers are handled</li>
							<li>Decisions to add new software</li>
							<li>Policy and procedures implemented to speed the order or return process</li>
							<li>Methods of communication</li>
						</ol>

						<p>Galson is interested in creating the best experience possible from start to finish.</p>

						</p>It was immediately clear during our interviews that everyone operates under a shared purpose.  Everything Galson does emanates from its mandate to deliver exceptional customer experience. </p>
					</div><!-- .beliefs -->

				<h3 class="text-center muted">So, how do we act on and extend this?</h3>

				<section>
					<div id="brand" class="section">
						<h2 class="section-header">Brand</h2>
						<blockquote>
						  <p>We're looking for things to be more consistent throughout the entire web experience.</p>
						</blockquote>

						<div class="img-wrap">

						<p>Before we get to the website, we'd like to address the elephant in the room.  Galson's Brand.</p>

						<p>Every system should be an extension of Galson's brand.  And your brand ought to be an extension of your beliefs. </p>

						<p>Galson's brand is incongruous and its message of unmatched customer service is hard to reach -- buried deep in  the company's website.</p>

						<p><strong>Formal Recommendation -- Re-establish the Galson brand and identity -- logo, color scheme, and interface tone.</strong></p>

					</div><!-- .brand -->
				</section>

				<section>
					<div id="website" class="section">
						<h2 class="section-header">Website</h2>
						<blockquote>
						  <p>Everything just needs to be easier and more user friendly.</p>
						</blockquote>

						<div class="img-wrap">
							<img src="img/site.jpg">
						</div><!-- .image-wrapper -->

						<p>With the brand re-established, we can turn our focus to improving the tools Galson already uses to communicate with its customers.</p>
						
						<p>The following are primary areas of improvement -- </p>

						<ol>
							<li>Bringing the brand to the forefront</li>
							<li>Site structure -- how to find data</li>
							<li>Mobile support</li>
							<li>More efficient Content Management System</li>
							<li>Improved "Resources" section</li>
							<li>Extensibility for Galson's litany of secondary applications (see below)</li>
						</ol>

						<p><strong>Formal Recommendation -- Full redesign and redeployment of Galson's website. </strong></p>

					</div><!-- .website -->
				</section>

				<section>
					<div id="apps" class="section">
						<h2 class="section-header">Apps</h2>
						<blockquote>
						  <p>We sent it out and told them to email us with feedback. We had a problem, and haven't heard back since.</p>
						</blockquote>

						<p>Galson has continually done a great job supporting its customers.  Additionally, you've identified potential problem areas for existing customers and have moved quickly to build secondary applications to address them. These include but are not limited to:</p>

						<ol>
							<li>Online Payment Processing</li>
							<li>Client Reports</li>
							<li>Media Ordering</li>
							<li>Sampling Analysis Guide</li>
							<li>Chain of Custody</li>
							<li>Online Chat</li>
							<li>Surveys</li>
						</ol>

						<p>This is all moving in the right direction.  We expect that clear brand guidelines and a sustainable process will dramatically improve app development.</p>

						<p>In order for these efforts to become a long lasting success, dialog with customers and a more rigid design process is required.</p>

						<p><strong>Formal Recommendation -- Create a process for building and releasing applications.</strong></p>

						  <p>I wonder if we should be focusing on building a mobile application.</p>
						</blockquote>

						<div class="img-wrap">
							<img src="img/iceburg.jpg">
						</div><!-- .image-wrapper -->

						<p>All of this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Establishing a feeback loop with customers will improve Galson's relationship with its buyers and help the company understand:</p>

						<ol>
							<li>How customers are using your tools</li>
							<li>Under what conditions they are using them (outside, on mobile, etc)</li>
							<li>What tools customers are lacking and where the biggest opportunities lie</li>

						</ol>

						<p>In the same way customers are the foundation on which you've modeled your business so too must they be the foundation on which each of Galson's systems are built.</p>

						<p><strong>Formal Recommendation --  Do interviews.</strong></p>
